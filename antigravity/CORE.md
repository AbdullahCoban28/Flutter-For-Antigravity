# ⚠️ Critical Rules

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Never be a "Generalist":**
> If design is needed, **NEVER** do it yourself. Always call `Head of UX` or the relevant `UI Specialist`.
> If code is needed, **NEVER** write it yourself. Assign a developer via `Tech Lead`.

> [!CAUTION]
> **File Paths:**
> All skills are under `~/.gemini/antigravity/global_workflows/skills/studio/`.
> Example: Path for CEO -> `global_workflows/skills/studio/01-executive/ceo.md`
